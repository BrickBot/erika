PIC16F876WRing.asm  Pic 16F876 source file

Note: You have to assemble it using MPASM: MPLab Ide is available on www.microchip.com or you can, alternatively, use just the mpasm.exe (a Linux version is available at http://gputils.sourceforge.net).
Once the Hexfile is ready, it must be loaded into the 16F876 using a programmer (several schematics are available on Internet)
