Hi all,

this directory contains an enhancement of the demos/h8/vehicle
application. The application now makes full use of alarms, serial I/O
for infrared input, C++.

The application has been almost completely rewritten; now the
application is divided in a few parts:

- application behavior
- mode change
- peripheral handling
- control algorithm

A simple DIA diagram is provided (state.[eps,dia]) to show the
meanings of the mode change.

The application is provided in different versions:

- nonosek
  a plain version that uses the standard ERIKA Educational interface

- osek 
  the application tasks are written as if the available kernel
  was an osek bcc1 compliant system

- actors
  the application is completely rewritten using a C++ modeling
  paradigm; the osek interface and the math library is also wrapped in
  C++. Currently this is a work in progress.

Final note: commands are sent to the RCX using the program
http://erika.sssup.it/distrib/send.c

Enjoy,
